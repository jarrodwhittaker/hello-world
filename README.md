# hello-world

Waddup my intellectual peeps.

My name is Jarrod Whittaker. I am a massive fan of games, both video games and board games, I compete in running events (100m, 200m, 400m) and watch a fair amount of anime and youtube (even the odd Twitch stream). My favourite video game franchise is the Jak and Daxter series.
